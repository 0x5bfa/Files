<p>Created from the ground up to look and feel amazing, Files is built to replace the outdated Windows File Explorer.</p>
<br>
<h3>Download Files</h3>
<p>Files will eventually be available in the Microsoft Store (Hopefully by Winter 2018), but you may download the source code and build the app in Visual Studio, or <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cXCNPNoJWLj59lBV0SPxb5x3HYjphOFy?usp=sharing">download</a> a precompiled sideload package. Please note: these builds are unstable, incomplete, and only work on the latest <b>April Update 1803</b>.</p> 
<br>
<p>There are many helpful features on the way! If you have a good technical skillset and a desire to contribute, feel free to boot up Visual Studio and crack open the source code. As you can tell, Files is still in its early stages of development and very incomplete.</p>
